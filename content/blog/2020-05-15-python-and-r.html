Reticulate is a package that allows Python and R scripts to talk to each other. Objects and and functions can be imported from .py files and used in R. Additionally, cells in a file can be designated to write Python code.</p>

<p>Both R and Python are useful tools. I have taken classes in both Python and R, and there are things I prefer to do in one over the other. For instance, I much prefer to define functions and object classes in python. Here, I am making a class called Card. A Card object can be any card you would find in a normal deck. I also define the function Draw, which will return a randomly selected Card object.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>import random
class Card (object):
  RANKS = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13)

  SUITS = (&#39;C&#39;, &#39;D&#39;, &#39;H&#39;, &#39;S&#39;)

  # constructor
  def __init__ (self, rank = 12, suit = &#39;S&#39;):
    if (rank in Card.RANKS):
      self.rank = rank
    else:
      self.rank = 12

    if (suit in Card.SUITS):
      self.suit = suit
    else:
      self.suit = &#39;S&#39;

  # string representation of a Card object
  def __str__ (self):
    if (self.rank == 1):
      rank = &#39;A&#39;
    elif (self.rank == 13):
      rank = &#39;K&#39;
    elif (self.rank == 12):
      rank = &#39;Q&#39;
    elif (self.rank == 11):
      rank = &#39;J&#39;
    else:
      rank = str (self.rank)
    return rank + self.suit

  # equality tests
  def __eq__ (self, other):
    return self.rank == other.rank

  def __ne__ (self, other):
    return self.rank != other.rank

  def __lt__ (self, other):
    return self.rank &lt; other.rank

  def __le__ (self, other):
    return self.rank &lt;= other.rank

  def __gt__ (self, other):
    return self.rank &gt; other.rank

  def __ge__ (self, other):
    return self.rank &gt;= other.rank

def draw(num):
  if num &gt; (13*4) or num &lt; 1:
    return (&quot;incorrect input&quot;)
  deck = []
  for i in Card.RANKS:
    for j in Card.SUITS:
      deck.append(Card(i, j))
  drawn = []
  while num &gt; 0:
    num = num - 1
    random.shuffle(deck)
    drawn.append(deck.pop())
  return(drawn)</code></pre>
<p>I then call the function I defined in Python and interact with it in some R code. Though this is a very trivial example, I love that I can blend the functionality of R and Python, and do certain tasks in the environment I am more cofortable with. However, this example also shows a limitation to using R and Python in tandem. R does not recognize the Card object type, and can only display their string representation. In Python I would be able to compare these cards, because that method was defined for the Python Card object. In R, the code ‘drawn[1] == drawn[2]’ returns an error saying ‘comparison of these types is not implemented’.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>drawn = py$draw(4)
print(&quot;cards:&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;cards:&quot;</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>for (i in drawn) print(i)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 6H
## JS
## 2S
## KS</code></pre>
<p>R was first built to be a tool of statistical analysis, and I prefer it for that. It’s ‘dplyr’ and ‘ggplot’ functions also make it my prefered environment for manipulating dataframes and most data visualization. That being said, I would switch back to Python for most machine learning tasks. You can find examples of this in my projects tab.</p>
<p>Initially, I had wanted to call a Python script that requires user input. I quickly realized that I knew little enough about the reticulate library, and would have to make shiny app as well. I decided that it wouldn’t be prudent to do that, condsidering the deadline for this project. However, check this site at the end of summer. If I can sucessfully do all of that I will post it here.</p>
