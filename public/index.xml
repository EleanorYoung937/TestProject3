      <description>Introduction This tutorial will show you how to create a simple theme in Hugo. I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won&amp;rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.
We&amp;rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template.</description>

      <description>Hugo uses the excellent go html/template library for its template engine. It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in go templates.
This document is a brief primer on using go templates.</description>

      <title>Migrate to Hugo from Jekyll</title>

      <description>Move static content to static Jekyll has a rule that any directory not starting with _ will be copied as-is to the _site output. Hugo keeps all static content under static. You should therefore move it all there. With Jekyll, something that looked like
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ images/ logo.png  should become
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ static/ ▾ images/ logo.png  Additionally, you&amp;rsquo;ll want any files that should reside at the root (such as CNAME) to be moved to static.</description>

      <description>My primary source of data is the 2015 Human Data Report, which I accessed through Kaggle. It measures the following variables for each country: Human Development Index (HDI), Life Expectancy at Birth, Expected Years of Education, Mean Years of Education, Gross National Income (GNI) per Capita. I also included the happiness score for each country from the 2017 World Happiness Report, which I also accessed through Kaggle. All of these are numerical data.</description>

      <description>R MarkdownIntroduction:I am incredibly interested in sustainibility, as I will witness the major effects of climate change in my life time. I chose the first datasets to investigate dietary choice by region and the co2 emmissions their production is responsible for. The dataset is from the tidytuesday github run by the rfordatascience group. The dataset countains varaibles specifying the country and type of food, as well as the consumption rate in units of kg/person/year and the rate of emmisions in units of CO2/person/year.</description>
