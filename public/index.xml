      <description>My primary source of data is the 2015 Human Data Report, which I accessed through Kaggle. It measures the following variables for each country: Human Development Index (HDI), Life Expectancy at Birth, Expected Years of Education, Mean Years of Education, Gross National Income (GNI) per Capita. I also included the happiness score for each country from the 2017 World Happiness Report, which I also accessed through Kaggle. All of these are numerical data.</description>

      <description>R MarkdownIntroduction:I am incredibly interested in sustainibility, as I will witness the major effects of climate change in my life time. I chose the first datasets to investigate dietary choice by region and the co2 emmissions their production is responsible for. The dataset is from the tidytuesday github run by the rfordatascience group. The dataset countains varaibles specifying the country and type of food, as well as the consumption rate in units of kg/person/year and the rate of emmisions in units of CO2/person/year.</description>
